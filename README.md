A triangle-y twist on a classic game

This was a game I made a couple of years ago to learn coffeescript.  I'm still in the process of cleaning up the code, 
as I've learned a lot since then.

To play, go to [jmdx.github.io](http://jmdx.github.io).  Warning: music will play.  The controls are the arrow keys, with the up
key for rotations and the Z key for switching the direction of "gravity".  Enjoy!
